# T-Update

This is a one-click unofficial [Tales of Maj'Eyal](https://te4.org) updater for the non-Steam macOS version of the game, which keeps addons (like the official Ashes, Embers, and Cults DLCs) intact. With this there's no need to manually reinstall the game and addons individually for each update.

It stays next to the game for easy access when an update is available.

Download, installation, and addon preservation are automatic.
